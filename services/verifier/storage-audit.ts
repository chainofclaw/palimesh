/**
 * Storage challenge audit sampling (Phase C2.4).
 *
 * Given a storage receipt, 5% of the time (configurable via
 * `auditSampleBps`) we independently re-fetch the challenged chunk
 * from a second peer that also advertises the CID, recompute
 * `hashLeaf(bytes)`, and compare to the `leafHash` the prover
 * returned. If they disagree, the prover either:
 *  - fabricated a proof without actually holding the bytes
 *    (leafHash != real hash of real bytes), or
 *  - colluded with its DHT-advertised provider set so the only peer
 *    that would have served the challenged chunk is itself.
 * Either way, the result code flips to `InvalidStorageAudit` and the
 * storageBps tally for that node drops.
 *
 * Keeping the sampler as a plain function makes it trivially unit-
 * testable and reusable across both the agent's V2 happy path
 * (palimesh-agent.ts) and the ReceiptVerifierV2 pipeline when it
 * eventually gets wired. The function only needs the injection points
 * — it does not know about EIP-712, nonce registries, or Merkle
 * math-only proof validation; those layers stay with the caller.
