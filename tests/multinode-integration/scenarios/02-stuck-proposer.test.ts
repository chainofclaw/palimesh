/**
 * Phase J3 scenario 02 — stuck proposer self-clear via H15b watchdog.
 *
 * Reproduces the 2026-05-05 testnet "self-stuck proposer" pattern: node-2
 * was the proposer for height H, formed an internal BFT round, but no peer
 * prepares ever reached its coordinator. The round state pinned at
 * prepareVotes=1 (self only), commitVotes=0, and the H15b stagger
 * watchdog (designed for "all 3 nodes equivocating") didn't apply because
 * stuckProposerId === self → early return. Required `docker restart` to
 * recover.
 *
 * J2.2 fix: when stuckProposerId === self AND active round exists AND
 * elapsed > NO_PROGRESS_TIMEOUT_MS (120s default), the watchdog calls
 * bft.forceClearRound() so the next propose tick can start fresh.
 *
 * Acceptance: chain height advances ≥3 blocks within 4 minutes (≤2 ×
 * NO_PROGRESS_TIMEOUT_MS) of the fault injection ending.
