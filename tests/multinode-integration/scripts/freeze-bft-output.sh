# Phase J3: pause outbound BFT messages from a node for N seconds.
#
# Reproduces the 2026-05-05 testnet "stuck proposer" pattern: node-2 was
# the proposer for height 206804, formed an internal BFT round with 1
# self-vote, but no peer prepares ever arrived (buffered=0). With a
# self-stuck round and strict 3/3 quorum, the chain stalled until docker
# restart was applied manually.
#
# Strategy: disconnect the target node from the docker bridge network for
# DURATION_S seconds, then reconnect. This simulates a partition so peer
# BFT messages can't reach the proposer's BFT coordinator.
#
# Usage: ./freeze-bft-output.sh <node-name> [<duration_s>]
