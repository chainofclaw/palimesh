/**
 * In-place upgrade of the PoSeManagerV2 UUPS proxy on 88780.
 *
 * Since gen-5 (UUPS conversion), PoSeManagerV2 lives behind a proxy. To ship
 * a code change, this script compiles the new implementation, validates it
 * against the storage layout the OpenZeppelin upgrades plugin recorded in
 * `contracts/.openzeppelin/palimesh-88780.json`, and calls `upgradeToAndCall` on
 * the existing proxy.
 *
 * The upgrade tx must be sent by the proxy's `owner` — which after the gen-5
 * handoff is the 3-of-5 multisig. That means in production this script is
 * really used to *prepare* the new implementation and the encoded
 * `upgradeToAndCall` calldata for multisig signing; the deployer key alone
 * cannot push the upgrade through. For testnet ad-hoc upgrades, the multisig
 * signs via its normal flow.
 *
 * Environment:
 *   DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY  — must be non-public (preflight enforces). For the
 *                           actual on-chain upgrade tx the proxy's `owner`
 *                           (the multisig) must sign; this script will revert
 *                           if the deployer is not the owner. Use multisig
 *                           tooling to construct the tx if needed.
 *   POSEV2_PROXY_ADDR     — required; the existing PoSeManagerV2 proxy.
 *   PALI_RPC_URL / PALI_CHAIN_ID
