/**
 * Propose the PoSeManagerV2 #746 upgrade tx to the Gnosis Safe owning the
 * proxy. Reads the prepared impl from `tmp/upgrade-746-prepared.json`
 * (output of `upgrade-pose-manager-v2-746.js`) and submits a Safe Tx
 * Service proposal that, when executed by N-of-M multisig signers,
 * points the live proxy at the new implementation.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   PALI_RPC_URL=https://<88780-rpc> \
 *   SAFE_TX_SERVICE_URL=https://<safe-tx-service-for-88780> \
 *   PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x<proposer-eoa> \
 *   POSE_MULTISIG_ADDRESS=0x<safe-address> \
 *   npx ts-node scripts/safe-propose-pose-upgrade-746.ts
 *
 * Required env
 *   - PALI_RPC_URL         JSON-RPC for 88780.
 *   - SAFE_TX_SERVICE_URL Safe Tx Service base URL. If your network is not
 *                         in Safe Global's hosted index, run your own
 *                         instance (https://github.com/safe-global/safe-tx-service).
 *   - POSE_MULTISIG_ADDRESS  The Safe holding ownership of the PoSeManagerV2
 *                            proxy (must match the proxy's `owner()`).
 *   - PROPOSER_PRIVATE_KEY EOA that signs the proposal (must be one of the
 *                          Safe owners). DOES NOT execute; signers approve
 *                          via Safe UI afterwards.
 *
 * Safety
 * ------
 * - Constructs an `upgradeToAndCall(newImpl, "")` call with empty init data.
 *   No re-initialization runs on the proxy; pre-upgrade storage is fully
 *   preserved (UUPS, OZ upgrade-safety validated already).
 * - Calls `proxy.owner()` and asserts it equals POSE_MULTISIG_ADDRESS — if
 *   the owner changed (e.g. ownership was transferred to GovernanceDAO),
 *   ABORT and re-coordinate.
 * - The proposal is created but NOT executed. Signers approve through the
 *   Safe UI; quorum is the Safe's own threshold (not this script's choice).
 *
 * After execution
 * ---------------
 * - Verify the upgrade via `eth_call` on `proxy.implementation()` (ERC-1967
 *   slot). The address should now match `prepared.newImpl`.
 * - Submit a sentinel `submitBatchV2WithMetadata` batch from a privileged
 *   aggregator with a tiny metadata payload to assert the new path works.
