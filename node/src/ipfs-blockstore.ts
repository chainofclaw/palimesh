/**
 * Optional hook contract for integrating the blockstore with P2P routing

 *
 *  - `fetchRemote(cid)`: called by `get()` when the CID is absent locally.
 *    Should return the block's bytes on success, or `null` to let the
 *    ENOENT propagate. Implementations typically consult DHT provider
 *    records (`DhtNetwork.findProviders`) and then pull via
 *    `WireConnectionManager.requestBlockFromAny`. Returned bytes are
 *    written to the local blockstore before the get result is returned,
 *    so the next access is free.
 *
 *  - `onPut(cid, bytes, opts)`: fired immediately after a successful
 *    write. `opts.source` distinguishes a caller-driven write
 *    (`"local"` — user PUT, push RPC) from a cache-back of a remotely
 *    fetched block (`"remote-cache"` — fallback in `get()`). C1.4 uses
 *    this to push to K nearest peers on local PUT only — firing on
 *    remote-cache would cause every fetch to amplify into K pushes,
 *    cascading into a traffic storm. Both sources self-announce into
 *    the DHT (provider discovery), which is cheap. Handlers must not
 *    throw: errors are swallowed so the put itself still reports
 *    success to the caller.
