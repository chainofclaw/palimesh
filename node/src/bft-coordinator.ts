   * Liveness recovery after a restart. The durable vote-ledger rehydrates

   * (no self-equivocation). But nothing re-broadcasts those votes: a height
   * that was partly voted but NOT finalized when we crashed then stays silent
   * forever. Peers waiting on OUR commit to reach quorum never receive it, and
   * we refuse to prepare a fresh candidate — a permanent deadlock that a plain
   * atomic restart cannot break (88780, 2026-08-05: v4/v1 had committed block A
   * but on restart never re-broadcast it, so v5 sat one commit short forever).
   *
   * The fix is to REPLAY the exact votes we already persisted. Replaying an
   * identical (height, blockHash) is idempotent and never triggers
   * equivocation: the canonical signed message carries no round, and peers'
   * EquivocationDetector only flags a DIFFERENT blockHash for the same
   * (height, phase). We only replay heights still above the staleness floor
   * (i.e. unfinalized) — finalized heights are already pruned / on-chain.
   *
   * Commits are replayed before prepares: a commit implies we already
   * prepared, and it is the commit that unblocks peers stuck one vote short of
   * commit quorum. Prepares are replayed only for heights we prepared but did
   * NOT commit. Safe to call once on startup (after peers have had a moment to
   * connect); a no-op when the ledger holds nothing unfinalized.
