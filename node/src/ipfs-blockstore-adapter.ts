 * Bridges Palimesh's string-keyed {@link IpfsBlockstore} to the
 * `interface-blockstore` `Blockstore` that `ipfs-unixfs-importer` and
 * `ipfs-unixfs-exporter` expect.
 *
 * Only `get` / `put` / `has` are used by the importer/exporter path
 * (`ReadableStorage = Pick<Blockstore,'get'>`, `WritableStorage =
 * Pick<Blockstore,'put'>`); the remaining `Store` members are provided as
 * thin shims so the adapter is a structural superset and can be passed
 * wherever a `Blockstore` is wanted.
 *
 * The CID <-> string conversion is the only translation — block bytes pass
 * through verbatim. `get` routes through Palimesh's `store.get`, which
 * transparently peer-fetches absent blocks (C1.3) and content-verifies
 * them, so directory-DAG navigation works even over a partially-local DAG.
 *
 * DoS guard: a per-adapter `get` budget. A single HTTP request constructs
 * one adapter, so capping `get` calls bounds the block fan-out a malicious
 * (deep / wide / diamond) DAG can trigger. Construct a fresh adapter per
 * request to reset the budget.
