# Phase C4.1 — distributed-storage end-to-end smoke test.
#
# Validates the C1+C3 pipeline end-to-end in a 3-node devnet:
#   1. PUT a file into node-1's IPFS HTTP gateway.
#   2. Assert ≥ 2 distinct DHT providers claim the root CID after
#      C1.4's push-to-K fans out + C3.1's replication wait.
#   3. Kill node-1 (the uploader / origin).
#   4. GET the file from node-2 and diff the bytes against the upload.
#      The read path goes through C1.3's blockstore fetchRemote
#      fallback — node-2 didn't originate the CID, so the bytes must
#      come from the C1.4 push replica stored on node-2 or from
#      node-3 via wire BlockRequest.
#
# Exits 0 on success, non-zero on any assertion failure. Designed to
# be runnable as a pre-merge check and inside CI.
