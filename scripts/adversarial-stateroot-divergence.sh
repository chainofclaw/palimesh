# adversarial-stateroot-divergence.sh — live-devnet validation that Phase B's
# (blockHash, stateRoot) pair quorum defends against validators whose local
# speculative execution produces a different post-state than the rest of the
# cluster.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/adversarial-stateroot-divergence.sh [5|7]   # default 5
#
# Requires ≥ 5 validators. With 3 validators, `quorumThreshold` in bft.ts
# (floor(2/3 * totalStake) + 1) collapses to "all 3 must agree" so a single
# liar already stalls the round, making Scenario A indistinguishable from
# Scenario B. With 5 equal-stake validators, threshold = 3334 out of 5000
# (needs 4/5 voters on the same pair), so the two scenarios diverge cleanly:
#
#   Scenario A — "single liar, honest majority outvotes" (5 validators):
#     node-1 launched with PALI_UNSAFE_ADVERSARIAL_SPEC_ROOT set to a fixed
#     poisoned 0x…deadbeef… value. Its speculativelyComputeStateRoot
#     short-circuits and returns that poison on every block, so its BFT
#     prepare votes land in (blockHash, poisonRoot). Nodes 2-5 run clean
#     and vote (blockHash, realRoot) — 4/5 agreement, above threshold,
#     pair quorum forms on the real root, chain finalizes normally.
#     Node-1's vote is wasted every round but never corrupts state.
#     Pass condition: chain advances ≥ 5 blocks AND nodes 2-5 stateRoots
#     agree at tip.
#
#   Scenario B — "two liars to distinct poisons, no majority on any pair":
#     node-1 and node-2 launched with DIFFERENT poisoned values; nodes 3-5
#     run clean. Prepare votes split 1/1/3 across three distinct pairs.
#     Honest pair only has 3/5 stake (3000 < 3334 threshold) — no quorum.
#     Prepare rounds repeatedly time out, cluster stalls at genesis. This
#     is the correct fail-closed behavior (better to halt than finalize a
#     block whose post-state 2/5 validators disagree with).
#     Pass condition: max observed height stays ≤ 1 for the full window.
#
# Baseline comparison (not run here): on main pre-Phase B, Scenario A would
# pass silently because hash-only quorum ignores the stateRoot entirely —
# node-1's lie has zero effect. Scenario B would ALSO "pass" (chain would
# advance) for the same reason, masking the fact that validators disagreed
# on post-state. This script proves Phase B both (a) fails closed on real
# disagreement and (b) doesn't spuriously fail on a single liar.
#
# Exit code: 0 on both scenarios matching their pass conditions; non-zero
# with a diagnostic otherwise.
