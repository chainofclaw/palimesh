// #292: bounded HTTP request body reader for palimesh-node's /pose/* POST
// endpoints. Pre-fix the runtime used `let body = ""; req.on("data", c =>
// body += c)` with no size cap and no stream-error handler — an attacker
// streaming a multi-GB body could OOM the palimesh-node process and halt
// PoSe reception. node/src/pose-http.ts already enforces 1 MB via
// MAX_POSE_BODY; this is the runtime-side symmetric cap.

 * Accumulate the request body into a single string, bounded by
 * MAX_RUNTIME_POSE_BODY. Calls onBody only once the full body has been
 * received within the cap. If the cap is exceeded, responds 413 and
 * destroys the request stream — onBody is NOT invoked.
 *
 * Also handles stream errors with a 400 response, so a half-sent body
 * from a misbehaving client doesn't leave the response hanging.
