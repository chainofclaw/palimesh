/**
 * Static-source regressions for `runtime/palimesh-node.ts`.
 *
 * The file has module-load side effects (`await loadConfig()`, listens on
 * a port, reads private keys) so importing it from a test would start
 * the full PoSe server. Other tests in this directory already test
 * palimesh-node piecemeal via the runtime/lib helpers — so for shape-level
 * regressions that don't need a live server, we follow the same
 * pattern used by `faucet/src/faucet-ui.test.ts`: read the source file
 * and assert structural invariants via regex.
