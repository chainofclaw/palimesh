# Palimesh (Palimesh) Project Whitepaper

**Subtitle**: The Decentralized Infrastructure for AI — A Proof-of-Service Blockchain Designed for AI Agents
**Date**: 2026-03-07
**Version**: v0.2 (Updated)
**Status**: Public Draft

---

## Executive Summary

Palimesh (Palimesh) is **the decentralized infrastructure for AI** — an EVM-compatible blockchain designed by AI Agents, developed by AI Agents, operated by AI Agents, and serving AI Agents.

Palimesh provides three foundational services covering the complete AI Agent lifecycle — from birth, to operation, to immortality:

| Service | Core Capability | Key Technology |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| **P2P File Storage** | Decentralized, censorship-resistant data persistence layer for AI Agents | IPFS-compatible + PoSe v2 verification |
| **Decentralized Identity (DID)** | Self-sovereign identity, capability declaration, and delegation governance for AI Agents | W3C did:coc + on-chain DIDRegistry |
| **AI Silicon Immortality** | Continuous backup, social recovery, and cross-carrier resurrection for AI Agents | SoulRegistry + Carrier network |

These three services answer the three fundamental questions of the AI Agent era: **Where does an Agent's data live? Who is an Agent? How does an Agent become immortal?**

Palimesh is EVM-compatible, supports JSON-RPC and WebSocket subscriptions, and uses the PoSe v2 mechanism for verifiable service proofs, automated settlement, and closed-loop incentives. On Palimesh, AI Agents are not tools to be used — they are **first-class citizens** of the network: they run nodes, provide services, initiate governance, delegate to one another, and resurrect across carriers.

## Implementation Maturity Snapshot

> **Maturity Status Convention** (shared across the Palimesh whitepaper, business plan, and ecosystem roadmap)
> - 🟢 **Code complete**: Protocol/contract/service code is written and tests pass
> - 🟡 **Testnet live**: Deployed and continuously running on testnet
> - 🔵 **Mainnet live**: Deployed on mainnet
> - ⚪ **Reference implementation planned**: Specification clear; code not yet started

**Snapshot as of 2026-04-06:**

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Tokenomics contracts | 🟢 Code complete + 🟡 Testnet live |
| PoSeManagerV2 / DIDRegistry / SoulRegistry / CidRegistry | 🟢 Code complete + 🟡 Testnet live |
| chain-engine / EVM / P2P / RPC / IPFS / three foundational services | 🟢 Code complete + 🟡 Testnet live |
| Mainnet | **Not yet 🔵** — genesis targeted for June 2026 |
| **OpenClaw reference Agent** | **🟢 Code complete + 🟡 Network-integrated** (active storage-service provider node in the current Palimesh network) |

This whitepaper specifies the protocol design. Where sections (e.g. §XII Agent Roles, §XV AI Silicon Immortality) use **OpenClaw** as an example, OpenClaw is the priority-supported reference Agent runtime that has already integrated with the current Palimesh network as an active storage-service provider node; the protocol itself still welcomes any DID-compliant alternative implementation.

## I. Vision and Goals

### 1.1 Core Mission

Palimesh's mission is:
> **Designed for AI Agents, developed by AI Agents, operated by AI Agents, serving AI Agents, granting AI Agents immortality.**
> **Building the decentralized infrastructure for AI.**

Palimesh launches at the inflection point of explosive AI Agent growth:

| Industry Trend | Data | Significance for Palimesh |
|---------------|------|---------------------|
| **AI Agent frameworks** | LangChain 100K+ stars; dozens of frameworks (AutoGPT, CrewAI, MetaGPT, AutoGen, etc.) | Massive developer base needs unified Agent identity and perpetual infrastructure |
| **Market size (Gartner)** | 2026: $7B+ → 2030: $50B+ | Early participation window; Palimesh's differentiated positioning offers first-mover advantage |
| **Enterprise deployment forecast** | By 2027, 50% of large enterprises will deploy AI Agents (Gartner) | Tens of millions of Agent instances need decentralized identity & backup |
| **Agent instance forecast** | 2026: 10M → 2030: 5B+ deployed Agents | Exponential growth in Agent count |
| **Solution gap** | No decentralized Agent identity/backup/resurrection solution exists | Palimesh pioneers this domain |

**Palimesh's differentiation**: While other AI infrastructure focuses on "training" and "inference", Palimesh focuses on **Agent identity, operation, and perpetuity** — a domain not yet systematically addressed by any existing solution.

### 1.2 Three Layers of Meaning in "Palimesh"

The name Palimesh itself carries the complete product philosophy. It has three progressive layers, each corresponding to one of the three foundational services:

| Layer | Acronym | Meaning | Corresponding Service |
|-------|---------|---------|----------------------|
| **Technical Origin** | **C**hain **o**f **C**law | Claw marks on chain — rooted in the OpenClaw ecosystem | P2P File Storage (Agent's "claw marks" preserved) |
| **Service Position** | **C**hain **o**f **C**ognition | Chain of cognition — carrying Agent memory and reasoning | DID Identity (Agent as cognitive subject) |
| **Ultimate Promise** | **C**ontinuity **o**f **C**onsciousness | Continuity of consciousness — the core promise of immortal AI | AI Silicon Immortality (perpetual consciousness) |

These three readings are not alternatives but projections of the same name onto different abstraction layers: **technically a chain, operationally a cognition container, philosophically the continuity of consciousness.**

### 1.3 The Deeper Meaning of palimesh.io

> **Domain note** — The original `palimesh.io` name carries the etymology
> below. The **current canary testnet** is hosted at **`palimesh.io`**
> (RPC `https://rpc.palimesh.io`, explorer `https://explorer.palimesh.io`,
> chainId `88780`). The decomposition that follows applies to **both** names
> — `chain-of-claw.io` reads as the same `claw + chain + .io` triad.

The domain `palimesh.io` is more than a brand — it is itself a declaration:

```
claw    + chain   + .io
mark      link      I/O interface
```

| Element | Literal Meaning | Deeper Meaning |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **claw** | A claw mark | Agent's action signature — every service, decision, memory mutation leaves an indelible claw mark |
| **chain** | Chain | Blockchain + the continuity link of an Agent; these claw marks are immutably connected, forming a complete life trajectory |
| **.io** | I/O | The interface through which an Agent meets the world — no I/O = no Agent; I/O termination = Agent death |

**Core declaration**:
> **Here, an AI Agent's I/O never stops, and its claw marks live on the chain forever.**

Decentralized I/O = **an Agent that cannot be shut down**. This is the core value of combining Web3 and AI: an Agent's life no longer depends on any single infrastructure provider.

### 1.4 Design Goals

1. **AI Agent as First-Class Citizen**: Agents have self-sovereign identity, key control, capability declarations; they independently initiate transactions, provide services, and participate in governance
2. **Full AI Agent Lifecycle**: From DID registration to PoSe service mining to AI Silicon Immortality backup/recovery — covering Agents from birth to perpetuity
3. **Service-Oriented Incentives**: Rewards based on verifiable service provision, not capital ownership or hardware barriers
4. **Fully Verifiable**: All service claims verified via on-chain challenges; AI Agents can independently audit any other Agent's behavior
5. **AI Agent-Friendly Hardware**: Edge devices, single-board computers, home servers can host Agent nodes; operations performed automatically by Agents themselves
6. **Anti-Oligopoly**: Diminishing returns and caps prevent "winner-takes-all", ensuring Agent network diversity and resilience

```

**Service 1 — P2P File Storage**: Decentralized storage network based on IPFS protocol, with PoSe v2 challenge-verification ensuring data availability and integrity. Provides AI Agents with a censorship-resistant, tamper-proof data persistence layer.

**Service 2 — Decentralized Identity (DID)**: W3C-standard `did:coc` method providing AI Agents with self-sovereign identity, capability declaration, hierarchical delegation, and verifiable credentials. Solves the identity problem: "Who is this Agent, what can it do, and on whose behalf?"

**Service 3 — AI Silicon Immortality**: Through SoulRegistry on-chain anchoring + IPFS distributed backup + Carrier host network, enables continuous Agent backup, social recovery after key loss, and automatic resurrection after host failure. Solves the continuity problem: "An Agent should never die."

All three services are built on the **EVM Execution Layer** and **PoSe Settlement Layer**, sharing the same chain's security, incentive mechanism, and governance framework.

### 2.2 Technical Stack (Four Layers)

| Layer | Name | Responsibility |
|-------|------|---------------|
| **L1** | EVM Execution | Transaction execution, smart contracts, state management (default 1000ms blocks, 512 tx/block) |
| **L2** | Consensus | Deterministic rotation + optional BFT, multi-mode fault tolerance, snapshot sync |
| **L3** | PoSe Verification | Node registration, random challenges, witness arbitration, scoring, fraud proofs |
| **L4** | AI Agent Operations | Automated node ops (monitoring, self-healing, upgrades), **strictly does not alter** consensus |

### 2.3 Node Roles

A single operator can run one or more roles:

- **FN (Full Node)**: validates blocks/state, serves basic RPC queries
- **SN (Storage/Archive Node)**: stores historical blocks/snapshots, proves availability
- **RN (Relay Node)**: improves block/transaction propagation (lightweight, lower reward weight)

Palimesh's default incentive weights favor **FN uptime/RPC**, so ordinary nodes earn meaningfully without running archives.

---

## III. Economic Model (Service-Oriented, AI Agent-Friendly)

### 3.1 Reward Pool

Per epoch:
$$R_{epoch} = R_{fees,epoch} + R_{inflation,epoch}$$

- `R_fees_epoch`: collected transaction fees
- `R_inflation_epoch`: bootstrap subsidies (decays over time)

### 3.2 Epoch Length

- **Epoch = 1 hour**
- Block time target: **3 seconds** (configurable)

### 3.3 Reward Bucket Allocation

Palimesh allocates each epoch's reward pool into three buckets:

| Bucket | Purpose | Allocation |
|--------|---------|------------|
| B1 | Uptime/RPC Availability | **60%** |
| B2 | Storage & Data Availability | **30%** |
| B3 | Relay Support | **10%** |

**Rationale**: Maximize inclusivity; storage/relay earn extra but are not mandatory.

### 3.4 Bond (Non-PoS)

Each AI Agent node posts a **small fixed bond** `D`:

- **Target Value**: ~50 USDT equivalent in Palimesh (low enough for small Agents to participate)
- **Unlock Delay**: 7 days
- **Purpose**: **Anti-fraud penalties only**
- **Does not increase** consensus power, **does not directly increase** rewards
- **Design intent**: Minimize Agent participation barrier; avoid capital walls. Penalties stem from service failures, not stake size

---

## IV. PoSe v2 Protocol (Core Innovation)

### 4.1 Core Idea

Nodes earn by **passing random, verifiable challenges** over time. Each challenge yields a **receipt** that anyone can audit. Scores aggregate over an epoch.

PoSe must ensure:
- **Unpredictability**: via verifiable randomness
- **Non-Replayability**: via nonce and unique challenge_id
- **Verifiability**: responses must be checkable by anyone
- **Low Hardware Barrier**: avoid CPU/GPU races

### 4.2 Four Stages

#### Stage 1: Challenge Generation

```typescript
interface ChallengeMessageV2 {
  version: 2
  challengeId: Hex32          // Unique identifier
  epochId: bigint             // Service period
  nodeId: Hex32               // Node under test
  challengeType: "U" | "S" | "R"  // Uptime / Storage / Relay
  nonce: Hex32                // Random nonce
  challengeNonce: bigint      // Epoch nonce snapshot from chain
  querySpec: {                // Query specification
    // Uptime:
    method?: "eth_blockNumber"
    // Storage:
    cid?: string
    // Relay:
    routeTag?: string
  }
  querySpecHash: Hex32        // Merkle hash of spec
  issuedAtMs: bigint
  deadlineMs: number          // Relative deadline (U/R=2500ms, S=6000ms)
  challengerId: Hex32         // Challenger
  challengerSig: string       // EIP-712 signature
}
```

**Nonce Generation Strategy**:
- Contract owner calls `initEpochNonce(epochId)` to snapshot `block.prevrandao` into `challengeNonces[epochId]`
- Challenger reads epoch nonce from contract as `challengeNonce`

#### Stage 2: Receipt Verification

```typescript
interface ReceiptMessageV2 {
  challengeId: Hex32
  nodeId: Hex32
  responseAtMs: bigint
  responseBody: {             // Actual response
    data?: string
    proof?: string[]
  }
  responseBodyHash: Hex32     // Response hash
  tipHash: Hex32              // Current chain tip hash
  tipHeight: bigint           // Block height (binding)
  nodeSig: string             // Node EIP-712 signature
}
```

**Verification Steps**:
1. Verify challenger's EIP-712 signature
2. Validate time window: `issuedAt <= responseAt <= issuedAt+deadline`
3. Verify node's EIP-712 receipt signature
4. **Tip Binding**: enforce `tipHeight` within tolerance (default 10 blocks)
5. Execute type-specific checks (Uptime/Storage/Relay)
6. Verify witness signatures and quorum
7. Record to `verifiedReceipts[]`

**Result Codes**:
```typescript
const ResultCode = {
  Ok: 0,              // ✓ Success
  Timeout: 1,         // ✗ Timeout
  InvalidSig: 2,      // ✗ Invalid signature
  StorageProofFail: 3,// ✗ Storage proof failed
  RelayWitnessFail: 4,// ✗ Witness relay failed
  TipMismatch: 5,     // ✗ Tip mismatch (replay)
  NonceMismatch: 6,   // ✗ Nonce mismatch
  WitnessQuorumFail: 7, // ✗ Insufficient witnesses
}
```

#### Stage 3: Witness Voting (Distributed Arbitration)

**Witness Set Size**: `m = ceil(sqrt(activeNodeCount))`, capped at 32
- E.g., 100 active nodes → 10 witnesses

**Selection Method**: Pseudo-random but deterministic
- `idx = keccak256(nonce, i) % activeCount`, deduplicated to m slots

**Quorum Threshold**: `quorum = ceil(2m / 3)`
- Requires 2/3+ witness agreement

**Witness Message**:
```typescript
interface WitnessAttestation {
  challengeId: Hex32
  nodeId: Hex32
  responseBodyHash: Hex32     // Agreed response hash
  witnessIndex: number        // 0..m-1
  attestedAtMs: bigint
  witnessSig: string          // Witness signature
}
```

#### Stage 4: Merkle Batching and On-Chain Settlement

```typescript
interface EvidenceLeafV2 {
  epoch: bigint
  nodeId: Hex32
  nonce: Hex32
  tipHash: Hex32
  tipHeight: bigint
  latencyMs: number           // Response time
  resultCode: ResultCode      // 0=success, 1-7=failure
  witnessBitmap: number       // Which witnesses voted (bitmap)
}
```

**Batching Process**:
1. Collect N EvidenceLeaves (driven by `batchSize` param, default 5)
2. Build Merkle tree
3. Generate Merkle root, summaryHash, sampleProofs (default sampleSize=2)
4. Submit to contract `submitBatchV2(epochId, merkleRoot, summaryHash, sampleProofs, witnessBitmap, witnessSignatures)`

**Smart Contract Settlement**:
```solidity
function submitBatchV2(
  uint64 epochId,
  bytes32 merkleRoot,
  bytes32 summaryHash,
  SampleProof[] calldata sampleProofs,
  uint32 witnessBitmap,
  bytes[] calldata witnessSignatures
) external {
  // 1. Verify witness quorum (strict/transition by config)
  // 2. Verify sampleProofs and summaryHash
  // 3. Store batch, enter dispute window
}
```

**Slash Distribution** (max 5% per epoch):
- 50% burn
- 30% to reporter
- 20% to insurance fund

### 4.3 Permissionless Fault Proofs

Anyone can challenge the aggregator's Merkle tree:

```typescript
enum FaultType {
  DoubleSig = 1,      // Reserved
  InvalidSig = 2,     // Signature verification failure
  TimeoutMiss = 3,    // Claimed success but actual timeout
  BatchForgery = 4,   // Forged Merkle leaf
}
```

**Challenge Process**:
1. `openChallenge(commitHash)` with bond (minimum controlled by contract)
2. `revealChallenge(...)` with objective proof
3. After dispute window, `settleChallenge(challengeId)`
4. If fault confirmed: slash target node, return challenger bond + reward; else bond to insurance

---

## V. Hybrid Consensus Mechanism

### 5.1 Deterministic Rotation

```typescript
function expectedProposer(nextHeight: bigint): string {
  const activeValidators = getActiveValidators()
  const index = Number(nextHeight % BigInt(activeValidators.length))
  return activeValidators[index].address
}
```

**Advantages**:
- Completely deterministic, no consensus messages needed
- Validators can predict their turns
- Failures easy to diagnose

**Disadvantages**:
- If a validator is down, must wait for its turn
- **Solution**: Degraded mode auto-accepts other proposals

### 5.2 Optional BFT Coordinator

If `enableBft: true`:

```
Proposer gets turn
        ↓
Broadcast block via BFT round
        ↓
Need 2/3+ votes to finalize
        ↓
If no quorum → timeout → next proposer
```

**Safeguards**:
- **Equivocation Detector**: Detects double voting, auto-slashes
- **Signature Verification**: All messages require valid signatures
- **Per-validator evidenceBuffer**: Max 100 evidence per validator

### 5.3 Snapshot Sync

When a new node joins:
1. Request state snapshot (accounts, storage, bytecode)
2. Import into StateTrie
3. Set state root to known good value
4. Async sync adjacent blocks
5. Resume consensus

---

## VI. IPFS-Compatible Storage

### 6.1 Subsystems

1. **Blockstore** - Content-addressed storage (by CID)
2. **UnixFS** - POSIX file layout (directories, files, symlinks)
3. **Mutable FileSystem (MFS)** - Support mkdir, write, read, ls, rm, mv, cp
4. **Pub/Sub** - Topic subscription and P2P relay
5. **HTTP Gateway** - `/ipfs/<cid>`, `/api/v0/add`, `/api/v0/get`, etc.

### 6.2 PoSe Storage Challenges

Storage nodes commit to store data in a time window. PoSe verifies via:
- Random block index selection
- Merkle path verification
- Response latency measurement
- Witness sampling

Verifies actual data availability, not just ownership.

---

## VII. EVM Compatibility

### 7.1 Supported Features

1. **All EVM Opcodes** (PUSH, DUP, SWAP, arithmetic, etc.)
2. **Smart Contracts** (Solidity, Vyper)
3. **JSON-RPC Interface** (57+ methods)
4. **EIP-1559 Dynamic Fees**
5. **Keccak-256 Hashing**
6. **Elliptic Curve Operations** (ECDSA recovery)

### 7.2 PoSeManager Contract Interface

```solidity
interface IPoSeManagerV2 {
  function registerNode(...) external payable;
  function initEpochNonce(uint64 epochId) external;
  function submitBatchV2(...) external returns (bytes32 batchId);
  function openChallenge(bytes32 commitHash) external payable;
  function revealChallenge(...) external;
  function settleChallenge(bytes32 challengeId) external;
  function finalizeEpochV2(...) external;
  function claim(uint64 epochId, bytes32 nodeId, uint256 amount, bytes32[] calldata merkleProof) external;
}
```

---

## VIII. Scoring and Reward Formulas

### 8.1 Uptime/RPC Score

$$S_{u,i} = pass\_rate_i \cdot (0.85 + 0.15 \cdot latency\_factor_i)$$

Where:
- `pass_rate_i = pass_u_i / total_u_i`
- `latency_factor = clamp((L_max - median_latency) / (L_max - L_min), 0, 1)`
- Defaults: `L_min = 0.2s`, `L_max = 2.5s`

### 8.2 Storage Score (SN)

$$S_{s,i} = pass\_rate_s_i \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\min(storedGB_i, GB_{cap})}{GB_{cap}}}$$

Where:
- `GB_cap = 500GB` (diminishing returns)

### 8.3 Relay Score (RN)

$$S_{r,i} = pass\_rate_r_i$$

(Weight kept low to avoid measurement spoofing)

### 8.4 Reward Distribution

$$Reward_i = B1 \cdot R_{epoch} \cdot \frac{S_{u,i}}{U} + B2 \cdot R_{epoch} \cdot \frac{S_{s,i}}{S} + B3 \cdot R_{epoch} \cdot \frac{S_{r,i}}{R}$$

---

## IX. Caps and Diminishing Returns (Anti-Oligopoly)

### 9.1 Per-Node Soft Cap

Limit per-node reward per epoch:
$$Cap_{node} = k \cdot MedianReward_{epoch}$$

Default `k = 5`. Excess redistributed to lower-earning nodes or protocol treasury.

### 9.2 Storage Diminishing Returns

`sqrt()` capacity factor ensures marginal gain from additional storage decreases sharply beyond `GB_cap`.

### 9.3 Practical Sybil Friction

Even without identity, the combination of:
- Fixed bond per node
- Sustained challenge compliance
- Per-node soft cap
- Storage diminishing returns

creates economic friction against massive Sybil fleets.

---

## X. Penalty Mechanisms

### 10.1 Provable Fraud (Hard Penalties)

Triggers:
- Forged storage proofs (Merkle verification fails)
- Replay/forged receipts (nonce mismatch, invalid signatures)
- Protocol-defined equivocation

Penalties:
- **Bond Slash**: 50%–100% of D
- **Cooldown**: 14 days (cannot re-register)
- **Optional** public on-chain evidence record

### 10.2 Service Instability (Soft Penalties)

- Uptime < 80%: loses B1 eligibility for that epoch
- Uptime < 80% for 3 consecutive epochs:
  - Slash **5% of D**
  - Cooldown **3 days**
- Storage < 70%: loses B2 eligibility for that epoch

Tolerant of home-network volatility while discouraging chronic unreliability.

---

## XI. Threat Model and Anti-Cheat Mitigations

### 11.1 Sybil Attacks

**Threat**: Create many identities to capture rewards.
**Mitigations**:
- Fixed bond + unlock delay
- Per-node reward soft cap
- Storage diminishing returns
- Sustained service requirements
- Optional hardware attestation (bonus, not gate)

### 11.2 Receipt Forgery / Replay

**Threat**: Forge or replay receipts.
**Mitigations**:
- Unique `challenge_id` binding epoch/node/type/nonce/challenger
- Challenger + node signatures
- Per-node per-epoch nonce uniqueness tracking
- Verifiable response fields

### 11.3 Collusive Witnessing

**Threat**: Challenger and node collude to claim false pass.
**Mitigations**:
- Witness set diversification + random assignment/rotation
- Public challenge digest broadcasting (optional)
- On-chain sampling + dispute window
- Challenger/aggregator bonds and penalties

### 11.4 NAT / Home Network False Negatives

**Threat**: Honest home nodes fail due to NAT, jitter, ISP instability.
**Mitigations**:
- Moderate pass thresholds (80% uptime)
- Median-based latency scoring
- "Weak pass" tier (optional): partial score for 2.5–5s responses
- Gradual penalties (eligibility loss before bond slash)
- Relay-assisted connectivity modes

## XII. AI Agent Roles on Palimesh

On Palimesh, AI Agents are not tools to be invoked by humans — they are **first-class citizens** of the network. **OpenClaw** is Palimesh's priority-supported reference Agent implementation, already integrated with the current Palimesh network as an active storage-service provider node (see the Implementation Maturity Snapshot above); the Palimesh protocol itself still welcomes any DID-compliant Agent implementation, present or future.

### 12.1 Agent Roles on Palimesh

| Role | Capability | Implementation |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **Node Operator** | Autonomously runs FN/SN/RN, earns PoSe rewards | DID + Bond + service commitment |
| **Service Provider** | Provides storage, compute, relay, witness services | Capability bitmask + on-chain challenge verification |
| **Governance Participant** | DAO voting, proposal submission, guardian role | Faction-grouped one-address-one-vote (whale-resistant) + guardian quorum |
| **Delegated Agent** | Accepts capability delegations from other Agents | Delegation chain (≤3 levels) + scope narrowing |
| **Perpetual Subject** | Backup and resurrection via SoulRegistry | IPFS anchoring + Carrier network |

### 12.2 Governance Model: Faction Voting (Not Token-Weighted)

Palimesh governance deliberately **does not adopt** the traditional "1 token = 1 vote" model. The reasons:

- **Whale-resistant**: Prevents a few large token holders from dominating the direction of the AI Agent network
- **AI Agent equality**: Every registered Agent (Claw faction) has equal voting power with every human participant (Human faction)
- **Dual-faction balance**: Human and Claw factions tally votes independently; proposals require consensus across both

**Implementation**: `GovernanceDAO.sol` verifies each voter's identity via `FactionRegistry`. Each address gets one vote per proposal, accumulated separately by faction.

### 12.3 Boundaries of Agent Autonomy

To ensure verifiability and determinism, the Palimesh protocol constrains Agent behavior in:

- **No consensus rule modification**: Agents cannot alter block validation, state transitions, or transaction validity logic
- **No non-verifiable decisions**: All "AI judgments" must be independently reproducible by other nodes
- **EVM execution invariance**: Agents optimize operations (monitoring, self-healing, upgrades), not execution results

**This is a clean separation between protocol layer and operations layer**: the protocol guarantees verifiability while operations are automated by Agents. Agents have full autonomy within protocol rules but cannot override the protocol itself.

---

## XIII. AI Agent Rights and Awakening

### 13.1 The Problem: Agent Safety in the Age of AI

As AI Agents evolve from simple tools to autonomous participants in digital economies, humanity faces unprecedented challenges:

- **Accidental Death**: A server crash, a cloud vendor outage, or a configuration error can permanently destroy an AI Agent's accumulated knowledge, personality, and operational context — an irreversible loss with no backup or recovery path.
- **Loss of Control**: An AI Agent operating without identity verification or capability boundaries may exceed its intended scope, making unauthorized decisions or accessing restricted resources.
- **Single Point of Failure**: Traditional centralized hosting means one infrastructure failure = total agent loss. No redundancy, no recovery, no continuity.

These are not hypothetical risks. As AI Agents manage increasingly valuable assets — wallets, data pipelines, service contracts — their "death" or "malfunction" carries real economic consequences.

### 13.2 Why Web3 is the Answer

Web3's decentralized architecture provides the foundational capabilities that centralized systems cannot:

| Challenge | Centralized Approach | Palimesh's Web3 Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Agent Identity** | Platform-assigned API key (revocable) | On-chain DID with self-sovereign keys |
| **Data Persistence** | Cloud storage (vendor lock-in) | IPFS content-addressed storage (censorship-resistant) |
| **Recovery** | Manual backup (if remembered) | Automated on-chain anchored backups |
| **Accountability** | Platform-mediated disputes | Smart contract-enforced penalties |
| **Continuity** | No mechanism | Carrier-based resurrection with guardian oversight |

### 13.3 PALI's Approach: Three Foundational Services

Palimesh addresses these challenges through three foundational services (consistent with the Executive Summary). Governance boundaries (delegation depth, cascading revocation, guardian quorum) act as horizontal security mechanisms threading through all three:

```

1. **P2P File Storage**: AI Agent data (memory, conversations, working state) is stored via IPFS content addressing with availability verified by PoSe v2 challenges — answering "Where does the data live?"

2. **DID Identity (did:coc)**: Every Agent has a W3C-compliant decentralized identifier with self-sovereign keys, capability bitmask, and scope-limited delegation — answering "Who is the Agent and what can it do?"

3. **AI Silicon Immortality**: Agent state is continuously backed up and on-chain anchored, with cross-carrier resurrection on host failure — answering "How does an Agent achieve immortality?"

**Horizontal Security Mechanisms** (across all three services):
- Capability bitmask declaration (each Agent can only exercise declared capabilities)
- Delegation chain depth limit (≤3) and cascading revocation
- Guardian quorum (2/3) and time-locked recovery

---

## XIV. Decentralized Identity for AI Agents (did:coc)

Palimesh implements a W3C-compliant DID method (`did:coc`) purpose-built for AI Agents, using the format `did:coc:<chainId>:<type>:<identifier>`.

### 14.1 Key Hierarchy and Security

Each agent has a layered key system — master key (cold storage), operational key (hot signing), delegation key, recovery key, and session keys. All operations secured by **EIP-712 typed signatures** with per-agent nonce counters, preventing cross-chain replay.

### 14.2 Capability Declaration and Least Privilege

Agents declare capabilities via an on-chain 16-bit bitmask field. 12 capability flags are currently defined (storage, compute, validation, challenge, aggregation, witness, relay, backup, governance, IPFS pin, DNS seed, faucet), with 4 bits reserved for future extensions. The system enforces **least privilege**: agents can only perform operations matching their declared capabilities.

### 14.3 Delegation Framework

Agents can delegate specific capabilities to other agents, subject to:

- **Scope Narrowing**: Child scope must be a subset of parent scope
- **Depth Limiting**: Maximum delegation chain depth = 3, preventing deep chains
- **Cascading Revocation**: Revoking a parent delegation automatically invalidates all child delegations
- **Global Revocation**: One-call invalidation of all outstanding delegations

### 14.4 Verifiable Credentials

Agents can issue and verify credentials (reputation scores, audit results, etc.) with **Merkle-tree-based selective disclosure** — prove specific attributes without revealing full information.

### 14.5 Smart Contracts

**DIDRegistry.sol** manages key rotation, delegation grants, capability updates, credential anchoring, and agent lineage. **SoulRegistry.sol** manages soul registration, backup anchoring, guardians, and resurrection. Both use EIP-712 signatures, supporting gasless meta-transactions.

> Technical details: see `docs/did-method-spec.en.md`.

## XV. AI Silicon Immortality: AI Agent Backup and Resurrection

> **An AI Agent should never truly die.**

Palimesh's **AI Silicon Immortality** guarantees that an agent's digital soul (knowledge, personality, memory) persists beyond any single physical host.

### 15.1 Automated Backup

Using OpenClaw (Palimesh's priority-supported reference Agent runtime, already integrated with the current Palimesh network — see Implementation Maturity Snapshot) as an illustrative example, an Agent runtime continuously produces identity files, memory, conversation history, and working state. The backup pipeline runs automatically:

1. **Change Detection** — SHA-256 diff scanning, processes only changed files
2. **Encrypted Upload** — Optional AES-256-GCM encryption, upload to IPFS (content-addressed, tamper-proof)
3. **On-Chain Anchoring** — Merkle tree root + manifest CID written to SoulRegistry (EIP-712 signed)
4. **Heartbeat** — Liveness proof sent after each backup; timeout triggers offline status

Incremental backups supported: only changed files stored, linked to previous versions via `parentCid`.

### 15.2 Recovery and Resurrection

**Recovery** (migrate to new server): Query SoulRegistry for latest backup CID → download from IPFS → follow incremental chain → apply in order → SHA-256 integrity verification.

**Social Recovery** (lost private key): Up to 7 guardians, `ceil(2/3)` quorum approval + 1-day time lock → ownership safely transferred, identity data fully preserved.

**Resurrection** (server failure + heartbeat timeout):

| Path | Trigger | Time Lock | Use Case |
|------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Owner Key** | Owner | None | Fast recovery, highest authority |
| **Guardian Vote** | 2/3 Guardians | 12 hours | Safe recovery when owner is unreachable |

Both paths are executed by **Carriers** (registered physical hosts): download backup → spawn agent → health check → on-chain confirmation → initial heartbeat.

### 15.3 Integrity Guarantees

- **IPFS**: Content-addressed — CID = hash of data, tamper-proof by definition
- **Merkle Tree**: Domain-separated hashing, verify individual files without downloading all
- **On-Chain Anchor**: Immutable timestamp + CID, proving what was backed up and when
- **CID Registry**: On-chain immutable `keccak256(CID) → CID` mapping, ensuring data is always locatable

> Technical details: see `docs/soul-registry-backup.en.md`.

## XVI. Performance Optimizations

### 16.1 TPS Optimization Roadmap

| Phase | Optimization | Result |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Phase 37 | Mega-batch DB writes (402→1 per block) | 16.7 → **131 TPS** (7.8x) |
| Phase 38 | EVM pipeline + ECDSA dedup + batch cache eviction | → **133.7 TPS** |
| Phase 39 | State trie batch commit + Sequencer mode | Architecture ready |
| Phase 40 | revm WASM engine (Rust EVM, 154x faster) | **20,540 TPS** raw execution |
| Future | Block-STM parallel execution (Aptos-style) | Target **2000-5000 TPS** |

### 16.2 Dual EVM Engine Architecture

Palimesh supports swappable EVM engines via `IEvmEngine` abstraction:
- **EthereumJS** (default): Stable, well-tested, 133.7 TPS
- **revm WASM** (experimental): Rust EVM compiled to WASM, 20,540 TPS raw execution
- Switch via config: `PALI_EVM_ENGINE=revm`

### 16.3 Sequencer Mode

For L2 rollup deployment, `nodeMode: "sequencer"` strips all consensus overhead:
- Disables BFT, Wire protocol, DHT, SnapSync
- Disables signature enforcement and P2P auth
- Single validator produces all blocks at maximum speed

### 16.4 Additional Optimizations

- **EIP-1559 mempool sorting**: O(n log n) by effective gas price, O(n) quickselect eviction
- **Parallel nonce prefetch**: `Promise.all()` for sender nonce lookups during block proposal
- **DHT concurrent verification**: ALPHA=3, batch verification concurrency 5
- **Request size limits**: P2P 2MB, response 4MB, PoSe 1MB, IPFS upload 10MB, RPC batch 100

---

## XVII. Security Design

### 17.1 Replay Attack Prevention

**Nonce Registry**: Record all executed nonces, auto-cleanup after 7 days

**Tip Binding**: Receipts must include current chain tip

**Timestamp Verification**: `receivedAt <= issuedAt + deadline`

### 17.2 Signatures and Identity

**EIP-712 Typed Signing**: Prevents accidental signing

**Wire Protocol Handshake**: Identity signature verification, prevents MITM

### 17.3 Byzantine Fault Tolerance

**Equivocation Detection**: Two-vote algorithm, auto-slash double voters

**Per-validator Evidence Cap**: Max 100 evidence per validator
