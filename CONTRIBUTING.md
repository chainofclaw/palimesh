## Getting Started

1. **Find an issue**: Browse [open issues](https://github.com/palimesh/palimesh/issues) or the [Project Board](https://github.com/users/palimesh/projects/1)

5. **Submit PR**: Reference the issue number

## Development Setup

```bash
# Prerequisites: Node.js 22+
git clone https://github.com/palimesh/palimesh.git
cd Palimesh
npm install

# Run node
cd node && npm start

## Code Guidelines

- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode, no `any`)
- **Tests**: Required for all new features (node:test framework)
- **Style**: Comments in English, keep files under 500 LOC

- **Error handling**: Always handle errors with meaningful messages

## Security

For security vulnerabilities, **do not** open a public GitHub issue. See
the canonical [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) for the full disclosure policy,
severity-tier rewards (canary testnet: $100–$50,000 USD-equivalent),
response timeline (24h ack for Critical), and safe-harbor terms. Quick
paths:

- Email `security@palimesh.io` (preferred for time-sensitive)
- GitHub private advisory: <https://github.com/palimesh/palimesh/security/advisories/new>
